    You run down a long corridor then up a flight of metal stairs.
    They make a loud racket as you clamber up them. Thank goodness the machinery
    in this place is so loud.



    In front of you is the emergency exit door.
    It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from a bolted handle. You could try
    picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry it off.



    What to do?



    1.
    Pick it.

    2. Pry it.'
