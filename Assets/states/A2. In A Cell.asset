    Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and
    end up dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old
    and patched together with plate metal and thick red wires.

    

    You have
    no idea where you are. And your head hurts.

    

    So, what to do now,
    slugger?

    

    1. Wait it out. My head hurts.

    2. Slam into the door
    with all my might.'
